## üß† Abstract

This paper presents a risk-informed data-driven safe control design approach for a class of stochastic uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems. The nonlinear system is modeled using linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. A model-based probabilistic safe controller is first designed to guarantee probabilistic Œª-contractivity (i.e., stability and invariance) of the LPV system with respect to a given polyhedral safe set. To obviate the requirement of knowing the LPV system model and to bypass identifying its open-loop model, its closed-loop data-based representation is provided in terms of state and scheduling data as well as a decision variable. It is shown that the variance of the closed-loop system, as well as the probability of safety satisfaction, depends on the decision variable and the noise covariance. A minimum-variance direct data-driven gain-scheduling safe control design approach is presented next by designing the decision variable such that all possible closed-loop system realizations satisfy safety with the highest confidence level. This minimum-variance approach is a control-oriented learning method since it minimizes the variance of the state of the closed-loop system with respect to the safe set, and thus minimizes the risk of safety violation. Unlike the certainty-equivalent approach that results in a risk-neutral control design, the minimum-variance method leads to a risk-averse control design. It is shown that the presented direct risk-averse learning approach requires weaker data richness conditions than existing indirect learning methods based on system identification and can lead to a lower risk of safety violation. Two simulation examples along with an experimental validation on an autonomous vehicle are provided to show the effectiveness of the presented approach.

## üéØ Overview

This work develops a robust, risk-informed, model-free safe control framework for LPV systems using only I/O data:
- **Data-driven closed-loop representation**: Bypass open-loop model identification by directly using collected state-input-scheduling data under gain-scheduling feedback.
- **Probabilistic safety**: Guarantee Œª-contractivity of polyhedral safe sets in probability under Gaussian disturbances.
- **Risk-averse design**: Formulate and solve optimization (LP/SDP) to minimize variance of closed-loop behavior w.r.t. safe set, improving safety confidence.
- **Data efficiency**: Requires weaker data-richness conditions compared to model-based identification.
- **Practical validation**: Two examples demonstrate effectiveness:
  1. **Magnetic suspension system**: MATLAB scripts compute safe-control gains ensuring constraints on position and velocity.
  2. **Robotic vehicle path tracking**: MATLAB-computed gains are used in a Python ROS 2 node for real-time deployment on a mobile robot; includes Gazebo simulation and real-world experiments.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Example 1: Magnetic Suspension (MATLAB only)
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to `matlab/example1_magnetic_suspension/`.
2. Run `generate_data.m` to collect or simulate input-output data under perturbations.
3. Run `compute_safe_gains.m` to compute risk-informed safe-control gains ensuring constraints on position and velocity.
4. Run `simulate_suspension.m` to simulate closed-loop response and verify constraint satisfaction.
