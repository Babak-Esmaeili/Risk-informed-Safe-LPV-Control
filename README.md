## üß† Abstract

This paper presents a risk-informed data-driven safe control design approach for stochastic uncertain nonlinear systems modeled as LPV systems. A model-based probabilistic safe controller is first designed to guarantee probabilistic Œª-contractivity of a given safe set. A direct data-driven representation of the closed-loop LPV system is then used to design a minimum-variance risk-averse safe controller that minimizes the variance of safety violations. Two practical examples are provided: (1) a magnetic suspension system computing safe-control gains to satisfy position/velocity constraints, and (2) a robotic vehicle path-tracking scenario where MATLAB-computed gains are deployed in a Python ROS 2 node for real-time safety-critical control, demonstrated in Gazebo simulation and real-world tests.

## üéØ Overview

This work develops a robust, risk-informed, model-free safe control framework for LPV systems using only I/O data:
- **Data-driven closed-loop representation**: Bypass open-loop model identification by directly using collected state-input-scheduling data under gain-scheduling feedback.
- **Probabilistic safety**: Guarantee Œª-contractivity of polyhedral safe sets in probability under Gaussian disturbances.
- **Risk-averse design**: Formulate and solve optimization (LP/SDP) to minimize variance of closed-loop behavior w.r.t. safe set, improving safety confidence.
- **Data efficiency**: Requires weaker data-richness conditions compared to model-based identification.
- **Practical validation**: Two examples demonstrate effectiveness:
  1. **Magnetic suspension system**: MATLAB scripts compute safe-control gains ensuring constraints on position and velocity.
  2. **Robotic vehicle path tracking**: MATLAB-computed gains are used in a Python ROS 2 node for real-time deployment on a mobile robot; includes Gazebo simulation and real-world experiments.

## üõ† Requirements

- **MATLAB R2018a or newer**: for running MATLAB example scripts.
- **Python 3.8+**, **ROS 2** (e.g., Foxy/Galactic/Humble) and related packages: for deploying the ROS 2 node.
- **Gazebo**: for simulation of the robotic vehicle.
- **NumPy**, **rclpy**, **sensor_msgs**, **geometry_msgs**, etc.: Python dependencies for ROS 2 node.
- **YALMIP/MOSEK** or **CVX/MOSEK** in MATLAB: for solving LP in safe gain computation.
- A mobile robot platform compatible with ROS 2 for real-world validation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Example 1: Magnetic Suspension (MATLAB only)
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to `matlab/example1_magnetic_suspension/`.
2. Run `generate_data.m` to collect or simulate input-output data under perturbations.
3. Run `compute_safe_gains.m` to compute risk-informed safe-control gains ensuring constraints on position and velocity.
4. Run `simulate_suspension.m` to simulate closed-loop response and verify constraint satisfaction.
5. Inspect plots of trajectories and safe-set adherence.
